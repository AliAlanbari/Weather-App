# Weather-App
This was my first project, I took on this project as a learning oppritunity. I started this project with knowledge next to nothing regarding API and their function. It require a lot of research and tweaking to finally put it together, but I eventually was able to make an app that will show the weather and its description of any location in the world. Although after that, I decided to add a live clock of the location search for. I found another API that will give me time data of any location and I implemented it into my project. The result is a weather app of any location with a live updating clock of said location.
